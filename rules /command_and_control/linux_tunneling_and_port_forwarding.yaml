# Title: Linux Tunneling And Port Forwarding

# Creation date: 2023/08/23

# Category: Command and control

# Severity: Medium

# Description: This rule monitors for a set of Linux utilities that can be used for tunneling and port forwarding. Attackers can 
# leverage tunneling and port forwarding techniques to bypass network defenses, establish hidden communication channels, 
# and gain unauthorized access to internal resources, facilitating data exfiltration, lateral movement, and remote control.
