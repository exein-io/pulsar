# Title: Linux Chisel Server Activity

# Creation date: 2023/08/23

# Category: Command and control

# Severity: Medium

# Description: This rule monitors for common command line flags leveraged by the Chisel server utility followed by a received connection
# within a timespan of 1 minute. Chisel is a command-line utility used for creating and managing TCP and UDP tunnels,
# enabling port forwarding and secure communication between machines. Attackers can abuse the Chisel utility to establish
# covert communication channels, bypass network restrictions, and carry out malicious activities by creating tunnels that
# allow unauthorized access to internal systems.
