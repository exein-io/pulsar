# Title: Gdb Init Memory Dump

# Creation date: 2023/08/30

# Category: Credential access

# Severity: Medium

# Description: This rule monitors for the potential memory dump of the init process (PID 1) through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory 
# dumping techniques to attempt secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include
# "truffleproc" and "bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly.
