- name: OpenSSL Password Hash Generation
  type: Exec
  category: persistence
  severity: low
  description: Detects the usage of the `openssl` binary to generate password hashes on Linux systems. The `openssl` command
    is a cryptographic utility that can be used to generate password hashes. Attackers may use `openssl` to generate
    password hashes for new user accounts or to change the password of existing accounts, which can be leveraged to maintain
    persistence on a Linux system.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "openssl" AND payload.argv CONTAINS "passwd"
