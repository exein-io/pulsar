# Title: Telnet Network Activity External

# Severity: Medium

# Description: Telnet provides a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server. This rule identifies Telnet network connections to routable IP addresses.

# False Positives: Telnet can be used for both benign or malicious purposes. Telnet is included by default in some Linux distributions, so its presence is not inherently suspicious. 
# The use of Telnet to manage devices remotely has declined in recent years in favor of more secure protocols such as SSH. Telnet usage by non-automated tools or frameworks may be suspicious.
