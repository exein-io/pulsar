# Title: Telnet Network Activity External

# Creation date: 2020/04/23

# False Positives: Telnet can be used for both benign or malicious purposes. Telnet is included by default in some Linux distributions, so its presence is not inherently suspicious. 
# The use of Telnet to manage devices remotely has declined in recent years in favor of more secure protocols such as SSH. Telnet usage by non-automated tools or frameworks may be suspicious.
