# Severity: Low

# Description: This rule monitors for potential attempts to disable AppArmor. AppArmor is a Linux security module that enforces 
# fine-grained access control policies to restrict the actions and resources that specific applications and processes can
# access. Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities.
