- name: Creation of shared object files
  type: FileCreated
  category: defense_evasion
  severity: medium
  description: Detects the creation of a hidden shared object (.so) file. Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." 
    as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system 
    for persistence and defense evasion.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH ".so" AND payload.filename STARTS_WITH "." 
    AND NOT header.image IN ["/usr/bin/dockerd", "/usr/bin/azcopy", "/usr/local/bin/azcopy", "/usr/bin/podman"]
