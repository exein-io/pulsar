- name: Execution from proot
  type: Exec
  category: defense_evasion
  severity: medium
  description: Identifies the execution of the PRoot utility, an open-source tool for user-space implementation of chroot, 
    mount --bind, and binfmt_misc. Adversaries can leverage PRoot to expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux 
    distributions and simplify their necessary efforts. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other
    architectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF),
    can be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or
    orchestrate another attack on the environment.
