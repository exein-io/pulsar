- name: Potential Sudo Privilege Escalation via CVE-2019-14287
  type: Exec
  category: privilege_escalation
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of a suspicious sudo command that is leveraged in CVE-2019-14287 to escalate
    privileges to root. Sudo does not verify the presence of the designated user ID and proceeds to execute using a user ID
    that can be chosen arbitrarily. By using the sudo privileges, the command "sudo -u#-1" translates to an ID of 0,
    representing the root user. This exploit may work for sudo versions prior to v1.28.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "sudo" AND payload.argv CONTAINS "-u#-1"
