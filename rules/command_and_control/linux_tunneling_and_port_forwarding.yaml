- name: Gost without parent process
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of Gost without a parent process. Gost is a command-line tool that
    enables the creation of a secure tunnel between a local and remote host, facilitating the transfer of data through an encrypted
    channel. Attackers can exploit the Gost to bypass network defenses, establish hidden communication channels, and gain 
    unauthorized access to internal resources, facilitating data exfiltration, lateral movement, and remote control.

- name: Pivotnacci without parent process
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of Pivotnacci without a parent process. Pivotnacci is a tool that
    allows you to create a socks server which communicates with HTTP agents. Attackers can exploit the Pivotnacci utility to establish 
    a hidden communication channel, bypass network defenses, and exfiltrate sensitive information, potentially enabling unauthorized 
    access to internal resources and remote control over compromised systems.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "pivotnacci"

- name: SSH with suspicious arguments
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of the SSH utility with suspicious arguments. Attackers can exploit the SSH utility 
    with chmod to establish a hidden communication channel, bypass network defenses, and exfiltrate sensitive information, potentially
    enabling unauthorized access to internal resources and remote control over compromised systems.
  condition:
    (payload.filename ENDS_WITH "/ssh" OR payload.filename ENDS_WITH  "/usr/sbin/sshd")  AND (payload.argv CONTAINS "-R"

- name: Sshuttle with suspicious arguments
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of Sshuttle with suspicious arguments. Sshuttle is a tool that enables the creation 
    of a VPN connection between a local and remote host, facilitating the routing of network connections through intermediary proxies. 
    Attackers can exploit the Sshuttle utility to bypass network defenses, establish hidden communication channels, and gain unauthorized 
    access to internal resources, potentially facilitating data exfiltration, lateral movement, and remote control.
  condition:
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "sshuttle" AND (payload.argv CONTAINS "-r" OR payload.argv CONTAINS "--remote" OR payload.argv CONTAINS "-l"

- name: Socat with suspicious arguments
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of Socat with suspicious arguments. Socat is a utility that allows for bidirectional 
    data transfer between two connections using various protocols such as TCP, UDP, SSL, Unix sockets, and more. It's often used for tasks 
    like port forwarding, proxying, and file transferring. Attackers can exploit the Socat utility to bypass network defenses, establish 
    hidden communication channels, and gain unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially facilitating data exfiltration, lateral 
    movement, and remote control.
  condition:
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "socat" AND (payload.argv CONTAINS "TCP4-LISTEN:" OR payload.argv CONTAINS "SOCKS") AND payload.argc >= 3

- name: Chisel client OR server mode
  type: Exec
  category: command_and_control
  severity: medium
  description: This rule monitors for the execution of Chisel in client or server mode. Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, secured 
    via SSH. It was designed to bypass network restrictions and securely communicate between two endpoints. Attackers can exploit 
    the Chisel utility to bypass network defenses, establish hidden communication channels, and gain unauthorized access to internal 
    resources, potentially facilitating data exfiltration, lateral movement, and remote control.
  condition:
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "chisel" AND (payload.argv CONTAINS "client" OR payload.argv CONTAINS "server")

  description: This rule monitors for the execution of various tunneling tools. Attackers can exploit these utilities to bypass network 
    defenses, establish hidden communication channels, and gain unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially facilitating data 
    exfiltration, lateral movement, and remote control.
