- name: DHCP Network Discover
  type: Send
  category: impact
  severity: low
  description: Detects DHCP starvation attempts by monitoring excessive DISCOVER packets to broadcast addresses. 
    Adversaries may exhaust the IP address pool by rapidly requesting many leases using spoofed MAC addresses.
  condition: payload.is_tcp == "false" AND
    (payload.destination.port == 67 OR payload.destination.port == 547) AND
    payload.len <= 400 AND
    payload.destination.ip IN ["255.255.255.255"] 
    AND NOT (
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dhcpd" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dhclient" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dnsmasq" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/isc-dhcp-server" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/NetworkManager" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/systemd-networkd"
    )

# DHCP Server Spoofing Detection
- name: Unauthorized DHCP Server
  type: Bind
  category: credential_access
  severity: medium
  description: Detects processes binding to DHCP server ports, which may indicate rogue DHCP services. 
    Adversaries may run malicious DHCP servers to redirect victim network traffic, leading to attacks like man-in-the-middle (MITM) or traffic interception.
  condition: payload.is_tcp == "false" AND 
      (payload.address.port == 67 OR payload.address.port == 68 OR payload.address.port == 546 OR payload.address.port == 547)
    AND NOT (
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dhcpd" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dhclient" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/dnsmasq" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/isc-dhcp-server" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/NetworkManager" OR
      header.image ENDS_WITH "/systemd-networkd"
    )

# DHCP Attack Tools Detection
- name: DHCP Attack Tools
  type: Exec
  category: credential_access
  severity: high
  description: Detects execution of known DHCP spoofing tools or suspicious command-line arguments that suggest malicious intent.
  condition: 
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "ettercap" OR 
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "bettercap" OR
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "yersinia" OR
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "responder" OR
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "mitmf" OR 
    (payload.argv CONTAINS "dhcp" AND (
      payload.argv CONTAINS "spoof" OR
      payload.argv CONTAINS "poison" OR
      payload.argv CONTAINS "hijack" OR
      payload.argv CONTAINS "--dhcp" OR
      payload.argv CONTAINS "-dhcp" OR
      payload.argv CONTAINS "--dhcp-spoof"
    ))
