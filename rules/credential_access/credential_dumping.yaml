# Severity: Medium

# Description: Identifies the execution of the unshadow utility which is part of John the Ripper,
# a password-cracking tool on the host machine. Malicious actors can use the utility to retrieve
# the combined contents of the '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/password' files.
# Using the combined file generated from the utility, the malicious threat actors can use them as input
# for password-cracking utilities or prepare themselves for future operations by gathering
# credential information of the victim.
