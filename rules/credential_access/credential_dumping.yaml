- name: Unshadow execution start
  type: Exec
  category: credential_access
  severity: medium
  description: Identifies the execution of the unshadow utility which is part of John the Ripper,
    a password-cracking tool on the host machine. Malicious actors can use the utility to retrieve
    the combined contents of the '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/password' files.
    Using the combined file generated from the utility, the malicious threat actors can use them as input
    for password-cracking utilities or prepare themselves for future operations by gathering
    credential information of the victim.
  condition: header.image ENDS_WITH "/unshadow" AND payload.argc >= 2

- name: strace execution with specific arguments
  type: Exec
  category: credential_access
  severity: medium
  description: Detects the execution of the ptrace syscall (called by strace) with specific arguments. Attackers can exploit ptrace to 
    dump the memory of the init process (PID 1) to extract sensitive information, potentially enabling unauthorized access to internal 
    resources and remote control over compromised systems.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "strace"
    AND (payload.argv CONTAINS "--pid"
      OR payload.argv CONTAINS "-p")
    AND payload.argv CONTAINS "1"

- name: Suspicious command targeting /proc filesystem
  type: FileOpened
  category: credential_access
  severity: low
  description: Detects attempt to search process memory for credential patterns within the /proc filesystem.
    Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or /proc. (Tools like LaZagne or MimiPenguin)
  condition: payload.filename STARTS_WITH "/proc" AND (payload.filename ENDS_WITH "/maps" OR payload.filename ENDS_WITH "/mem")
    AND payload.flags CONTAINS "O_RDONLY"
    AND NOT (header.image STARTS_WITH "/usr/lib64/" OR header.image STARTS_WITH "/usr/bin/grep")

- name: Suspicious gcore execution
  type: Exec
  category: credential_access
  severity: medium
  description: Detects use of `gcore` to create a core dump of a running process. Adversaries may use this to extract memory contents for credential harvesting.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "gcore"
    AND payload.argc >= 2
