# Severity: Medium

# Description: Identifies instances where a process named 'grep', 'egrep', or 'pgrep' is started on a Linux system with arguments
# related to virtual machine (VM) files, such as "vmdk", "vmx", "vmxf", "vmsd", "vmsn", "vswp", "vmss", "nvram",
# or "vmem". These file extensions are associated with VM-related file formats, and their presence in grep command
# arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to search for, analyze, or manipulate VM files on the system.
