  description: Monitors for the execution of unix utilities that are capable of conducting network scans.
    Adversaries may leverage built-in tools such as ping, netcat or socat to execute ping sweeps across the network while
    attempting to evade detection or due to the lack of network mapping tools available on the compromised host.
