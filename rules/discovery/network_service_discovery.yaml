- name: Potential Network Scan Executed From Host
  type: Exec
  category: discovery
  severity: low
  description: Detects the execution of Unix utilities capable of performing network scans, such as nping, hping, hping2, and hping3.
    Adversaries may use these tools to conduct ping sweeps or port scans during network service discovery, especially when traditional reconnaissance utilities are unavailable or when attempting to evade detection.
  condition: payload.filename ENDS_WITH "nping" OR payload.filename ENDS_WITH "hping" OR 
    payload.filename ENDS_WITH "hping2" OR payload.filename ENDS_WITH "hping3"
