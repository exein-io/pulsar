# Cross containers
#
# These containers are used in conjunction with [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to build Pulsar in a reproducible way without worrying about system dependencies.
#
# Containers are based on the default [cross containers](https://github.com/orgs/cross-rs/packages) built from `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, with the addition of:
#
# -   `Clang/LLVM 20`
# -   `libssl-dev` speficic for the target architecture, example `libssl-dev:arm64`
# -   `libsqlite3-dev` speficic for the target architecture, example `libsqlite3-dev:arm64`
